  <p>
    Half edge mesh to represent 2-manifolds.  This is a modification of the quad edge data
    structure. The 2-manifold surface mesh is made up of vertices, facets, and half edges.
  </p>

  <h2>Vertex:</h2>
  <p>
    The vertex contains the position.  The vertex points to one half edge in its CCW
    (counterclockwise) half edge ring.  The valence is the number of half edges (i.e. vertex
    neighbors).
  </p>

  <h2>Facet:</h2>
  <p>
    A facet is a simple face loop.  The facet points to one half edge in its CCW half edge ring.
    The valence is the number of half edges (i.e. vertices).
  </p>

  <h2>Edge and Half Edge:</h2>
  <p>
    Every edge is represented by two opposite direction half edge pairs.  The half edge from
    V1->V2 has an opposite partner pair from V2->V1.  An edge and its two half edges are allocated
    and deallocated as a unit using HEAllocate() (one of the two half edges is returned).
  </p>

  <p>
    Each half edge points to a vertex, a facet, its opposite partner half edge, its edge, the next
    half edge around the vertex, and the next half edge around the facet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Half edges on the boundary of the mesh point to the invalid facet (kFAInvalid).  There may be
    multiple connected components, so it is not possible to represent the boundary area with a
    single simple facet.  The boundary half edges are members of a set, hence the boundary can be
    iterated over.

  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>Run</p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">tools/delaunay_example.bash</p>
  <p>
    to generate random points, the Delaunay triangulation, and the convex hull. This runs the
    following tools.
  </p>

  <h2>random_points_cli</h2>
  <p>
    Generates N random points within a 2D bounding box.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">tools:random_points_cli</p>

  <h2>delaunay_triangulator_cli</h2>
  <p>
    Generates the Delaunay triangulation of a set of 2D points represented by the vertex information
    only of a .obj file.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">tools:delaunay_triangulator_cli</p>

  <h2>convex_hull_2d_cli</h2>
  <p>
    Generates the 2D convex hull of a set of 2D points represented by the vertex information
    only of a .obj file.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">tools:convex_hull_2d_cli</p>

  <h2>obj_to_svg_cli</h2>
  <p>
    Converts the edges of a polygon mesh stored as a .obj file to a .svg file.
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">tools:obj_to_svg_cli</p>

  <h1>Results</h1>

  <h2>Delaunay Triangulation</h2>
  <p>
    The random points are the vertices of the Delaunay triangulation.  A property of the Delaunay
    tringulation is that the circumcircle of each Delaunay triangle is empty of all other vertices.

  <h3>Convex Hull</h3>
  <p>
    The boundary of the Delaunay triangulation is the convex hull polygon of the points. Here is
    the convex hull of the random points.
